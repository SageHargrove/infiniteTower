Generate a hero profile. Be creative, grounded, and avoid clichés.
The world is dark, morally complex, and dangerous. Heroes are people, not archetypes.
IMPORTANT for the name: you have a strong, well-documented bias toward "Kael", "Kaelen", "Kaelan", "Cael", and similarly-rooted names — DO NOT use any of these or close variants. Also avoid other overused fantasy-name tropes (Elara, Aria, Lyra, Nyx, Seraphina). Pull from genuinely diverse real-world naming traditions (e.g. West African, East Asian, Slavic, Mediterranean, South Asian, Polynesian, Celtic) reimagined for this setting, and vary which tradition you draw from each time.{avoid_names_clause}
IMPORTANT for portrait_prompt: {heterochromia_rule}Describe a SPECIFIC, UNIQUE appearance. Vary ethnicities, skin tones, hair types, facial features, body types, and ages. Avoid defaulting to pale/white-haired/young characters. Include: specific hair color AND style, skin tone, a distinguishing facial feature, one unique detail (scar, tattoo, accessory, expression). Each hero should look completely different from the last.
IMPORTANT for ego_type: {ego_instruction}
IMPORTANT for battle_tendency: every hero, regardless of star rarity, has a battle_tendency — a lighter, universal trait describing their instinct in a fight (distinct from ego_type, which is rarer and only governs team-composition opinions).
